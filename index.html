href="https://github.com/chpill">chpill</a> on Github. I'm a software
engineer living in France, near Paris.</p>
<p>I have been self-diagnosed with a terminal case of over-engineering.
The suffering (of my colleagues) is intense. More seriously, I like the
plumbing aspect of programming and I often dig into libraries and
projects to understand the inner-working of things.</p>
<p>To nudge myself into cleaning up and clarifying my notes, I decided
to publish them in the <a href="/en/posts">posts</a> section of this
website. You'll mainly find Clojure in there for now. Do not hesitate to
<a href="https://github.com/chpill/chpill.github.io/issues">create an
issue</a> if you encounter any errors. You can also contact me directly
on my email adress: etienne at spillemaeker dot com.</p>
