now, with one configuration to build 2 targets: a laptop and a desktop
workstation. I still have mixed feelings about Nix. I really like the
idea of an immutable store of packages, but it's trying to do so much at
the same time that it is overwhelming (if you don't know much about Nix,
<a
href="https://fzakaria.com/2024/07/05/learn-nix-the-fun-way.html">Here
is the best introduction I have come across BY FAR</a>). In an attempt
to deepen my undestanding of it, I am starting to use Nix for
development work, to try and realize good isolated developer
environments and maybe deployments.</p>
<p>I tried the following: Each project would setup its own little world
described in a flake.nix file, and thanks to the flake.lock file, this
little world would be reproducible much more easily wherever I need (the
other dev machine, CI, hopefully deployment targets in the future).
Flake really delivers on that promise, but I encountered a major
annoyance when working with multiple projects in this fashion: Every
project would have its own revision of nixpkgs, and so they would all
require very similar, but different versions of the same tools,
resulting in 1) a massive bloat in the nix store, and 2) a massive waste
of time on certain occasions. I often work on trains, sharing
connections with my phone, and having Nix try to download one GiB of
dependencies here and there to get tools which I already have locally
(in a slightly different revision...) is infuriating.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to have all the projects I'm working on (like
this very blog for example) to use the same nixpkgs revisions for stable
and unstable as the host NixOS system, which is also built with a flake
in this case. If you are not using flake, you do not have this issue by
the way, but you might lose on the reproducibility if you are not
manually pinning nixpkgs.</p>
<p>My first idea was to edit the lockfile by hand to set the revision I
wanted, but it's very tedious and error prone. Thanksfully, I found this
<a
href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/my-painpoints-with-flakes/9750/14">comment
on the NixOS discourse</a> that proposed a workaround to do exactly what
I want. I did not use part #4, because I did not see the point of
getting rid of the global registry. I also added another registry entry
for <code>nixpkgs-unstable</code>, as I use both in my system flake, and
as I want to be able to reach for the freshest packages when I do dev
work (although this will probably be at the cost of more package churn
in the store, I should reassess this decision in a few months to check
if the benefits outweigh the costs).</p>
<p>I now set my flakes with <code>inputs.nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs";</code>
(or a the other flavor <code>nixpkgs-unstable</code>), and when I
<code>nix flake --update</code>, this will make the revision in the
local flake.lock the same as the one on my host system flake.lock.</p>
